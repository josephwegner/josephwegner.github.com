It's a funny thing, looking back at the last 2 and a half years of my life.  I graduated high school on June 5th, 2010, was married on June 12th, 2010, and had little idea what direction my life was going to take on June 13th, 2010.  At the time I was barely a novice programmer, and was significantly more interested in getting a day job that would consistently pay the bills than finding what I was passionate about.  I knew that I had never loved the idea of having a boss, but I figured that was just the way life went.



In late 2011 I discovered an organization called <a href="https://teensintech.com/">Teens in Tech</a>.  At that point I had begun teaching myself how to program, and ended up doing some development work for TinT.  It was a (very) short gig, but it helped me realize that there were options other than the rat race, even for teenagers like me.  Teens in Tech started a whirlwind of change in me - I launched a huge side project (80char), quit my job to get a Computer Science degree, promptly dropped out to join a startup, and now this. After much ado, I'm starting something.

That's right.  In January, my wonderful, beautiful, gracious wife and I are moving to San Francisco to start a company.  It's an incredibly exciting thing, to put my skills and abilities directly on the line - to use myself to my full potential, and directly reap the benefits.

I can't talk about what the startup actually is just yet, but I assure you I will be blogging very regularly about the startup very soon.
