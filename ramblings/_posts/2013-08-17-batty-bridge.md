I just love this version of spades, and have spent months looking for the instructions.  I just found them in an old board game box, and feel that they need to be documented on the internet.

The game is [Batty Bridge](/battybridge.html).  It's an alternative version of Spades, in which you have variable trump, different scoring values, and you rotate partners.  It's relatively awesome.

Here are [the instructions](/battybridge.html).
