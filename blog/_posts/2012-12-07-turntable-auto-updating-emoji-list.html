This is a bit of a shameless plug, but I had some requests to get a discoverable link up for my new Turntable Auto Updating Emoji list.

<!--more-->

All it does is loads in Turntable's CSS/JS files, and builds out a giant filterable list of all the available emoji.  Because it grabs the files fresh every time, it should always be completely updated.

Enjoy!
