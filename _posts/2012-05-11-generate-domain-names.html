As I approach a new phase in life (I'm leaving my current job, if you didn't know) the thought of starting something new keeps creeping into my head.  I keep looking around at all the people that are flourishing in the startup world and am simply jealous.  So, as I daydream I come to the realization that I don't have a ton of million-dollar ideas, and often fall back on trying to come up with awesome domain names and hoping an idea sprouts out of that (not really..  but perhaps a side project could).  So, today I wrote a little app that could fuel my time-wasting past time.  Check it out at <a href="http://domain.wegnerdesign.com">domain.wegnerdesign.com</a>

The idea was actually fueled by my love for <a href="http://www.gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> (and a bit of jealousy).  As the story goes, <a title="Sahil Lavingia" href="https://twitter.com/#!/shl">Sahil Lavingia</a> had this awesome idea for a startup.  So, he hacked away for a couple nights, and came to the point that he was ready to show the world an MVP.  If I understand it correctly, he had the domain gumroad.com sitting in a stockpile somewhere, and it just happened to be abstract enough to work.  Man, I wish I was that cool.

Speaking of Sahil and Gumroad, did you hear that he recently closed a<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/07/gumroad-7-million-series-a-kleiner-perkins/"> $7.7 million round of funding</a>?  Congrats, man.

If you're interested, the source for this app can be found on <a href="https://github.com/josephwegner/domainGenerator">Github</a>, and is written in Node.js.  There's a little portion that I wrote in PHP and haven't shared, but it's incredibly simple.  The only important part is that it's calling from a database of 200,000 possible words (that I may open source at some point).
