I wrote a post a few days ago titled, *[Why I Don't Write For Medium](https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/c7cc156bc5d9)*.  The post was a review of [Medium's Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/9db0094a1e0f) and how they are unnecessarily broad.  The point of the post was to say that, as writers, we deserve better respect for our writing.  Medium isn't the only writing platform, and there are many other places that don't require so much of your content.  The post got a lot of traffic - much more than I had ever expected it would get - and I regret that that post is now the most popular reflection of my writing.

This is not the first time that I have voiced concerns about a company's terms.  In fact, I do it often - whenever I will be posting content that is either sensitive or valuable, I read the terms.  There have been a number of times that I have disagreed with something in the terms, and on those occassions I have privately contacted the company about my concerns.  Each time I've had one of two responses; either the company politely corrects my misunderstanding of their terms, or we have a deeper discussion about how their terms reflect on them as a company, and how I as a customer view them.  Occasionally this has led to the company updating their terms or making certain parts more clear.  Every time - without fail - the discussion has ended with a good relationship between me and the company.  Each time I have felt valued as a customer, and in response have become invested in their product.

I took a different path this time - I posted my thoughts publicly.  Admittedly, I had been recognizing the rising popularity of Medium, and how every piece written about Medium quickly became popular.  I had a valid concern about Medium, had recently gotten my invite, and knew their would be a good audience.  In my head, I had justified it as the perfect convergence of scenarios leading me towards a public scathing of Medium's terms.  In reality, I was writing a formula in my head to become a troll.

I wrote the post, published it, and within minutes it was on the front page of Hacker News.  A few minutes after that it was the most recommended item on Medium, earning itself a spot on the homepage.  Medium now had on their homepage, in huge bold text, "Why I Don't Write For Medium".  It was at this point that I reflected on what I had done.

While I had written about something I had believed in - which certainly isn't wrong - I had done it in a way that resulted in more harm than good.  I have issues with Medium's terms of service, but I *do* believe in them as a company.  I think they have a good vision, and have the potential to serve the content creators of the internet very well.  My post did not reflect that - it portrayed Medium as a demon to the creative world, only purposed at sucking the life and value out of our writing.

The next day I wrote an email to Medium.  It was apologetic.  It was filled with compliments.  It was a very well crafted request for Medium to nullify my troll-guilt.  Their response was terse, and very clearly not forgiving.  I was outraged - I began crafting in my head a new blog post publicizing their rude response.  I wanted to let the world know how little Medium cared about their customers.  Then I realized, how can I apologize for something, and then be angered by the response?  Being sorry requires a willingness to bear the sorrow of not being forgiven.  I can't be both sorry and angry.

Instead of the angry Medium-bashing post I had written in my head, I'm writing this post.  I'm writing this as a warning to all other bloggers out there - there is a real difference between fame and infamy.  I have spent years building this blog and my brand as a creative, technically proficient, well thought-out voice.  In one 10:00 PM blog post, I'm now nothing more than a link-baiting critic.

Good writers write with integrity.  Good writers consider every work before they publish it, to make sure that it conveys what they want it to convey.  Good writers write about what they believe in, but they choose an appropriate medium to properly expose what they believe.
